# Feed-Me!
A short prototype, where you feed and grow a catfish

TL;DR: Eat - Upgrade - Grow - Survive - Repeat

Controls:
Mouse -> Cursor position dictates where the Catfish is moving towards, click to buy upgrades, click and hold to drag the upgrade menu, mouse wheel to zoom in and out while the upgrade menu is open



Current features:

- Eat food and grow
- Use food to upgrade your catfish
- 59 total upgrades, 56 are implemented at the moment
- Zoom in/out and move the upgrade menu using your mouse
- A few pitched down voice lines, meant to sound creepy (I hope it works)
- Some upgrades feature some artwork, others are blank
- Gain XP when eating
- After reaching level 1, you can click to Dash (depends on your speed)
- Enemies will spawn, dodge them if you can
- Once a certain upgrade has been bought and your catfish is big enough, you can eat enemies
- A second currency: money (unlocked after getting a certain food upgrade)
- Money can be used for additional upgrades and buying food (100$ -> 200 food)
- Handdrawn and "obtained" assets
